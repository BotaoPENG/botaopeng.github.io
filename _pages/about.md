I am an Associate Professor at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests include the design and optimization of systems for high-dimensional data and time series management and analysis, as well as the development of cross-domain data exchange systems. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Paris under Prof. Themis Palpanas.
